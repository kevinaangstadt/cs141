# Introduction
In today's world {term}`computers <computer>` are found almost everywhere we
turn. {term}`Computer Science` is the study of these computers, their design,
and associated computational phenomena.

Historically, a computer was an occupation—a person with significant training
and skill in performing mathematical computation. However, engineers have
continually attempted to automate computational tasks, first with mechanical
machines and then, beginning in the early 1900s, electronic devices. By the
midpoint of the century, computers were beginning to take over computational
tasks. This did not replace the human computer, but instead gave rise to a new
occupation: programmer.

## Electronic Circuits vs Computers
An electronic computer is a special type of electronic {term}`circuit`. Circuits
combine electronic components to perform some predetermined task. Traditionally,
a different circuit is needed for separate tasks. A computer, on the other hand,
avoids this by being a general-purpose circuit designed to execute a sequence of
instructions. If the set of support instructions is general enough, a computer
can perform quite a wide variety of tasks by re-ordering the sequence of
instructions without needing to rewire any of the components.
