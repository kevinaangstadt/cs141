# Glossary
```{glossary}
active low
: a signal or device that is considered active when it is in a low voltage state (0 or ground) rather than a high voltage state (1 or Vcc)

argument
: a piece of data (value) that is provided as input to a function when it is called

binary
: a number system based on two digits (0 and 1)
: a compiled program that can be executed directly by a processor

bit
: a binary digit, the smallest unit of data in computing, representing a value of either 0 or 1

bounce
: the rapid on/off switching of a mechanical switch when it is pressed or released, which can cause multiple signals to be generated instead of a single clean transition

built-in function
: a function that is provided as part of the programming language and is always available for use without needing to import any additional modules or libraries

bus
: a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers using a collection of wires

byte
: a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits, a common size for building blocks of data in computing

circuit
: a combination of electronic components that are connected together to perform some task

clock
: a signal that oscillates between high and low states at a constant frequency, used to synchronize the operations of a digital circuit

comment
: a note in the source code of a program that is ignored by the computer and is intended to provide explanations or context for human readers

computer
: an electronic device that can be programmed to carry out a sequence of instructions to perform a specific task or solve a mathematical or logical problem
: an occupation (predominantly pre-1960s) with an expertise in the calculation of data

computer science
: the study of computers and computational phenomena

console
: a text window where Python sends the output of `print` statements and where the user can also enter data from `input` statements.

constant
: a value that does not change during the execution of a program

digital
: uses discrete (rather than continuous) values. In the context of computers, this is often binary

diode
: an electronic component that allows current to flow in only one direction

duty cycle
: the percentage of one cycle in which a signal or system is active. In the context of square waves, it represents the proportion of time the signal is high (active) compared to the total duration of the wave.

embedded system
: a combined computer system containing a processor, memory, and input/output that is part of a larger mechanical or electronic system

floating-point
: a number that has a decimal point

frame rate
: the frequency at which consecutive images (frames) appear on a display or the human brain processes visual information, typically measured in frames per second (FPS)

frequency
: the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time, typically measured in hertz (Hz)

function
: a named block of code that performs a specific task and can be called (invoked) from other parts of a program
: a mathematical relation that maps inputs (arguments) in a domain set to outputs (return values) in a range set

general-purpose input/output (GPIO)
: configurable pins on a microcontroller that can be used for various input and output functions to interface with sensors and actuators

global variable
: a variable that is defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program

hexadecimal
: a number system based on sixteen digits (0-9 and A-F), often used in computing as a more compact representation of binary data

integer
: a whole number (i.e., no decimal point)

library
: a collection of pre-written code (functions, variables, etc.) that can be used to perform common tasks in a programming language

local variable
: a variable that is defined within a function and can only be accessed inside that function

microcontroller
: a small computer contained in a single integrated circuit that combines a processor, memory, input, and output

module
: a file containing Python code (functions, variables, etc.) that can be imported and used

operating system
: software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. Common examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android

parallel data
: a method of transmitting multiple pieces of information simultaneously across multiple channels

parameter
: a named variable in a function definition that stores the value of an argument passed to the function when it is called

period
: the duration of one complete cycle of a repeating event, typically measured in seconds. It is the reciprocal of frequency.

pulse-width modulation (PWM)
: a technique for varying the duty cycle of a digital signal to encode information

resistor
: an electronic component that limits the flow of electrical current in a circuit

scope
: the region of a program where a variable can be accessed or used

serial data
: a method of transmitting data one bit at a time over a single channel or wire

shift register
: a digital circuit that can store and shift data bits in a serial or parallel manner, often used for expanding the number of output pins in microcontroller applications

square wave
: a type of waveform that alternates between two levels (high and low) with a sudden transition between them, creating a square-like shape when plotted on a graph

statement
: a complete instruction in a programming language that tells the computer to perform a specific action

string literal
: in MicroPython, a sequence of characters between double quotes or single quotes

variable
: a named location in memory that can hold a value which may change during the execution of a program
