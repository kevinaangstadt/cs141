```{glossary}

argument
: a piece of data (value) that is provided as input to a function when it is called

binary
: a number system based on two digits (0 and 1)
: a compiled program that can be executed directly by a processor

built-in function
: a function that is provided as part of the programming language and is always available for use without needing to import any additional modules or libraries

circuit
: a combination of electronic components that are connected together to perform some task

comment
: a note in the source code of a program that is ignored by the computer and is intended to provide explanations or context for human readers

computer
: an electronic device that can be programmed to carry out a sequence of instructions to perform a specific task or solve a mathematical or logical problem
: an occupation (predominantly pre-1960s) with an expertise in the calculation of data

computer science
: the study of computers and computational phenomena

console
: a text window where Python sends the output of `print` statements and where the user can also enter data from `input` statements.

constant
: a value that does not change during the execution of a program

digital
: uses discrete (rather than continuous) values. In the context of computers, this is often binary

diode
: an electronic component that allows current to flow in only one direction

embedded system
: a combined computer system containing a processor, memory, and input/output that is part of a larger mechanical or electronic system

floating-point
: a number that has a decimal point

general-purpose input/output (GPIO)
: configurable pins on a microcontroller that can be used for various input and output functions to interface with sensors and actuators

integer
: a whole number (i.e., no decimal point)

library
: a collection of pre-written code (functions, variables, etc.) that can be used to perform common tasks in a programming language

microcontroller
: a small computer contained in a single integrated circuit that combines a processor, memory, input, and output

module
: a file containing Python code (functions, variables, etc.) that can be imported and used

operating system
: software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. Common examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android

resistor
: an electronic component that limits the flow of electrical current in a circuit

statement
: a complete instruction in a programming language that tells the computer to perform a specific action

string literal
: in MicroPython, a sequence of characters between double quotes or single quotes

variable
: a named location in memory that can hold a value which may change during the execution of a program
